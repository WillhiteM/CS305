Client Summary
The client for this course was Artemis Financial, a financial services company that handles sensitive customer data such as personal and financial information. Artemis Financial required a security review of their web-based software application to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and secure communication. The primary issue the company wanted addressed was reducing security risks in their application by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing secure coding practices that align with industry standards.

Strengths and Importance of Secure Coding
One area I performed well in was identifying software security vulnerabilities through structured analysis and automated scanning tools. I was able to recognize outdated dependencies, insecure communication risks, and weak configurations that could expose sensitive data. Secure coding is important because vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and loss of customer trust. Strong software security adds value to a company by protecting its reputation, ensuring regulatory compliance, and reducing long-term risk.

Challenging and Helpful Aspects of the Assessment
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was interpreting dependency scan results and determining which vulnerabilities posed the greatest risk versus those with lower impact. This process was also helpful because it improved my ability to prioritize risks based on severity, exploitability, and business impact rather than simply reacting to the number of reported issues.

Defense in Depth and Future Improvements
I increased layers of security by implementing encryption, secure communication using HTTPS, hashing for data integrity, and dependency monitoring. In the future, I would continue using tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis tools, and vulnerability databases to assess risks. I would also rely on established security frameworks and risk assessments to choose appropriate mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security
To ensure the application remained functional and secure, I tested the application after refactoring and re-ran vulnerability scans to confirm that fixes did not introduce new issues. Reviewing build results, dependency reports, and application behavior helped confirm that security improvements did not break functionality or create additional vulnerabilities.

Tools and Practices for Future Use
The tools and practices used in this project that will be useful in future work include OWASP Dependency-Check, secure encryption standards such as AES and SHA-256, certificate generation using Java Keytool, and secure coding principles. These tools and practices provide a strong foundation for building and maintaining secure applications.

Demonstrating Skills to Employers
For future employers, I would showcase the completed vulnerability assessment or secure software practices report to demonstrate my ability to analyze security risks, apply secure coding techniques, and follow industry best practices. This assignment shows my understanding of application security, risk mitigation, and my ability to document and communicate technical findings clearly.
